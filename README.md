# deep-learning-challenge
Module 21 Challenge

Overview: This project aims to analyze a dataset of a nonprofit organization and help them find successful applicants using machine learning and supervised learning. By using Google Colab, we are able to import neccesary libraries quickly that can help us complete the assignment.

Results: On my first attempt at running the simulation, I received an accuracy score of 0.7320, or 73.2%. Since the goal was to aim for an accuracy score of 75% or higher, I attempted two more simulations to try to improve it, however the improvements were minimal at 0.7273 accuracy and 0.7331 respectively.

Summary: While the accuracy score we received isn't terrible, there are many way to improve on it in the future, like adding additional hidden layers or using different machine learning techniques.
